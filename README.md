## 1. Planning Stage

### Project Goals
- **Goal:** Develop a machine learning model to predict user churn.
- **Objective:** Quantify the number of users who have uninstalled or stopped using the Waze app on a monthly basis.
- **Impact:** Help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.

### Strategies
- **Data Collection:** Gather historical data on user activity, engagement metrics, and churn events.
- **Team Roles:** Define roles and responsibilities within the data team.
- **Timeline:** Establish a project timeline with milestones for each stage.

### Business Impact
- **Retention Improvement:** Identify users at risk of churning and implement retention strategies.
- **User Engagement:** Increase user engagement through targeted interventions.
- **Revenue Growth:** Enhance user retention to drive revenue growth.

## 2. Analyzing Stage

### Data Summary
- **Data Sources:** Collect data from app usage logs, user profiles, and historical churn data.
- **Data Description:** Summarize the structure, types, and volumes of data available.

### Data Exploration
- **Initial Exploration:** Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions, correlations, and initial insights.
- **Cleaning and Preparation:** Address missing values, remove duplicates, and correct structural errors.

### Statistical Analysis
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Compute means, medians, standard deviations, and other relevant statistics.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Formulate and test hypotheses related to user churn factors.

## 3. Constructing Stage

### Model Building
- **Model Selection:** Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for churn prediction (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests).
- **Feature Engineering:** Create relevant features based on user activity, engagement metrics, and demographic data.
- **Training and Testing:** Split the data into training and testing sets, and build initial models.

### Model Interpretation
- **Validation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Refinement:** Iterate on model building by tuning hyperparameters and trying different algorithms.

## 4. Executing Stage

### Evaluation
- **Model Evaluation:** Perform final evaluation of the model on the test data.
- **Business Validation:** Ensure the model's predictions align with business objectives and stakeholder expectations.

### Communication
- **Reporting:** Create visualizations and reports to present findings and model performance.
- **Stakeholder Updates:** Regularly update stakeholders on project progress, insights, and outcomes.

### Deployment
- **Model Deployment:** Implement the model in a production environment to start predicting user churn.
- **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the model’s performance and make adjustments as necessary.
